### About
Entering from web-making, this class explores bundling, personal histories, and spatial intervention and progresses through workshops, discussions, and exercises in-and-out of the classroom. This intensive studio course takes place over a 5-week period in summer 2025, in person in New Haven, CT.

Artificial Intelligence tools and applications in web development will be a centered topic of our course, yet how to work with AI in this discourse will be explored, we will practice AI use in alignment of  code writing framework:
> From academic integrity at MIT: “Writing Code” (https://integrity.mit.edu/ handbook/writing-code):

> “writing code is similar to academic writing in that **when you use or adapt code developed by someone else as part of your project, you must cite your source.** however, instead of quoting or paraphrasing a source, you include an inline comment in the code. these comments not only ensure you are giving proper credit, but help with code understanding and debugging. ... you should not simply re-use code as the solution to an assignment. like academic writing, your code can incorporate the ideas of others but should reflect your original approach to the problem.”
