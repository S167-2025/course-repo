# Legend

Oral history that celebrates a primary orality of tribal cultures and confronts the historians' writing monopoly, Goethe once simply termed "legend." (Kittler, 1999). "Legends" travel across cultures and time; they exist before the so-called "histories" â€” stories that were authorized by historians with a writing monopoly, and only made their appearance after the end of the writing monopoly, and have continued evolving with the technologies we use to document and transmit stories.

In the *Legend* project, each person will search for a legend/folklore/story that either carries qualities of orality, or responds to alternative documenting and transmitting technologies that challenge the "authorized" writing monopoly.
