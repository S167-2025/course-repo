# Calendar

The measurement of time was born out from coordination of human activities, yet a digital calendar goes much further: In every calendar invite we send and accept, we clock a block of individual time for a shared event that as well requires the individual attention for collective contribution. Time, people, location, instructions, hyperlinks, alerts, and more alerts, they all become a public space and the properties that we inhabit together.

In the *Calendar* project, we will take digital calendar for a publishing practice: we collectively create a calendar subscription, where each participant contributes one entry over the course of five weeks. Each entry may contain up to 140 words of content of your choice.

All entries should be posted before **noon** on the publishing days. Please sign up for your publishing dates in the [Sign-up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCA_0KLCPTQO-Jp9vNeIYfdupQqk-JfGQLTN-tkx9xE/edit?usp=sharing).
