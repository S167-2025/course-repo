# Alt Text (and Metadata)

### 1. “What is alt text” from [Alt Text as Poetry](https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/)

Alt text is a written description of an image posted online. Alt text can also be added to images embedded in digital documents (PDFs, Word documents, Google docs, presentations, etc).

Alt text has multiple uses, but we are focused on its role as an essential part of web accessibility.

Alt text allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.

Blind people typically use software called a screen reader to access digital displays. The screen reader goes through the text on the screen and outputs it to a synthetic voice or refreshable braille display. On a website, a screen reader might readout options in the navigation bar, followed by the title, the first paragraph, the second paragraph, etc. When a screen reader encounters an image, it’s unable to “read” it. So instead, it looks for the alt text — a description of the image embedded in the code — and reads it out. This is how alt text functions as a non-visual alternative to an image.

### Eg.1: Alt Text from the Whitney Museum website
<img alt="Brightly colored chairs are arranged in a spacious room with large windows and a green and white painted wall." class="image" draggable="auto" style="aspect-ratio: 2400 / 1800 auto;" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://whitneymedia.org/assets/image/832369/small_WMAA92426_HEILMANN_02C.jpg 512w, https://whitneymedia.org/assets/image/832369/medium_WMAA92426_HEILMANN_02C.jpg 1024w, https://whitneymedia.org/assets/image/832369/large_WMAA92426_HEILMANN_02C.jpg 2048w" src="https://whitneymedia.org/assets/image/832369/large_WMAA92426_HEILMANN_02C.jpg">

## 2. What is metadata?
Alt text is a type of metadata. While the image itself being the *data*, all relevant information that describes the image is metadata.

## 3. Exercise: Haiku Writing for Alt Text

Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 morae (called on in Japanese) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern*.
