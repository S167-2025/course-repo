# Walk

> Deep Listening is listening in every possible way to everything possible to hear no matter what you are doing. Such intense listening includes the sounds of daily life, of nature, or one's own thoughts as well as musical sounds. â€” Pauline Oliveros

We will take a walk together to practice such Deep Listening, and collect the following materials for a "journal":
- 3 audio clips
- 2 video clip
- at least 5 images

Using writing to connect all the materials  from the walk, then we later convert this writing to a website. This journal should feature multiple locations, scenes, paths, and/or conversations with people you met during the walk.

Collect metadata from your walk, including:
- starting and ending time
- geo locations
- objects
- sound
- feelings
- timestamps of the feelings
- ...

Take note of subtle activities in the space, such as room tone, bird chirping, breeze or view changes over time. If you record video, consider how the video would introduce the experience to the audience, and similarly, think about how text and other formats can convey the experience.

Consider how the website creates a different experience compared to your initial walk, and how you would create this online walk for your audience through interactivity?

You can create the walk from a first-person perspective, including your internal and external activities, and/or compile metadata about the environment, such as time and spatial descriptions.

We will begin by creating an HTML-only version of the site, then adding CSS. Given the short timeframe of this project, text-based methods are recommended, but you are welcome to incorporate other formats such as images, audio, video, or any combination.
