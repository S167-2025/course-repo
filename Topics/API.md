# JSON and API

### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a string whose format very much resembles JavaScript object literal format. The following is a valid JSON string representing an object.

Exercise: write a JSON file together

### API
An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.

In real life, software API usually means a set of data that is accessible from a server:
```
async function getData() {
  const url = "https://example.org/products.json";
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const json = await response.json();
    console.log(json);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}
```
